o new quickcheck tests:
========================
    o run basic tests (insert/find/erase)
        x with insert()
        o with erase()
        o with find()
        o increase tests
        o and overwrite
        o and duplicates
========================
    o with a single db, very large key size, very low page size -> insert/erase
    o perform many inserts/erase
        o with extkeys + low extkey threshold
        o with duplicates + low duptable threshold
    o add transactions/recovery
    o add simulate system crashes, perform recovery

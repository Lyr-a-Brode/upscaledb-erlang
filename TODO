x ham_parameter_t in env_create, env_open, env_create_db, env_open_db
x test with in-memory environment
x run different configurations for the environment
x run different configurations for the various databases
x add license headers

o insert/erase/find
    x implement
========================
    o run basic tests (insert/find/erase)
        eqc: store each inserted key/value in an ordmap

currently i'm fighting with db_insert_command: the binary() generators need
to create keys/records with a size depending on the database flags and
parameters (key size, record size). But the database configuration (#dbstate)
is unknown when the generator is called!
========================
    o and overwrite
    o and duplicates
o use resource for file handles!

o test compilation if eqc is not installed - does it still work?
o need samples!
o improve documentation

o transactions
o cursor

o new tests:
    o reopen env while the test proceeds
    o very large key size, very low page size
    o perform many inserts/erase
        o with extkeys + low extkey threshold
        o with duplicates + low duptable threshold
    o add transactions/recovery
    o add simulate system crashes, perform recovery

x ham_parameter_t in env_create, env_open, env_create_db, env_open_db
x test with in-memory environment
x run different configurations for the environment
x run different configurations for the various databases
x add license headers
x insert/erase/find
x test compilation if eqc is not installed - does it still work?
x use resource for handles!
x transactions
    x erlang: db_find/db_insert/db_erase are implemented
    x txn_begin/txn_commit/txn_abort are missing
    x nifs are missing
    x tests/sample
        x move macros (HAM_TYPE_UINT32) into .hrl file!
x cursors
    x tests/sample
=================================
o need samples! (samples/readme.txt -> link to ham_tests.erl)
=================================
o improve documentation
    (i.e. parameter names for ham_env_create etc)
    move -spec() to hrl, use @spec and @type instead?

o new quickcheck tests:
========================
    o run basic tests (insert/find/erase)
        eqc: store each inserted key/value in an ordmap

currently i'm fighting with db_insert_command: the binary() generators need
to create keys/records with a size depending on the database flags and
parameters (key size, record size). But the database configuration (#dbstate)
is unknown when the generator is called!
-> maybe always use the same key type/size for all databases? but generate
    them in an outer FORALL loop!
    o and overwrite
    o and duplicates
========================
    o reopen env while the test proceeds
    o very large key size, very low page size
    o perform many inserts/erase
        o with extkeys + low extkey threshold
        o with duplicates + low duptable threshold
    o add transactions/recovery
    o add simulate system crashes, perform recovery
